# Introduction

## What is Google drive?

[Google Drive](https://developers.google.com/drive/api) allows users to store files on their servers, 
synchronize files across devices, and share files. Google Drive encompasses Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google 
Slides, which are a part of the Google Docs Editors office suite that permits the collaborative editing of documents, 
spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more. Files created and edited through the Google Docs suite are saved in Google Drive.

# Listener overview

The Google Drive Ballerina Connector allows you to access the 
[Google Drive API Version v3](https://developers.google.com/drive/api) through Ballerina. The connector can be used to implement some of the most common use cases of Google Drive. The connector provides the capability to programmatically manage files & folders in the drive.

The Google Drive Ballerina Connector supports file and folder management operations related to creating, deleting, 
updating and retrieving.

![alt text](/docs/images/connecter_overview.png?raw=true)

1. Listen to the new file creation event.
2. Listen to a new file created on a specific folder.
3. Listen to the new folder creation event.
4. Listen to new folder creation on a specific folder.
5. Listen to the file update event.
6. Listen to file deleted event.
7. Listen to file deleted event on a specific folder.
8. Listen to the folder delete event.
9. Listen to folder delete event on a specific folder.

# Prerequisites

* Java 11 Installed
Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 11 is required.

* Download the Ballerina [distribution](https://ballerinalang.org/downloads/)
Ballerina Swan Lake Alpha 4 is required.

* Domain used in the callback URL needs to be registered in google console as a verified domain.

# Supported versions & limitations

## Supported Versions

|                             |            Versions             |
|:---------------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| Ballerina Language          |     Swan Lake Alpha4    |
| Google Drive API            |             V3                  |

## Limitations

Google API v3 supports resource types - Files, Permissions, Changes, Replies, Revisions, Drives and Channels. Currently, 
Google drive connecter supports operations related to Files, Channels and Changes only. .It doesn't support admin related operations like creatin new shared drives.

# Quickstart

## Working with Google Drive Endpoint Actions

You must follow the following steps in order to obtain the tokens needed for the configuration of the Ballerina Connector.

1. Visit [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com), click **Create Project**, and follow the wizard to create a new project.
2. Go to **Credentials -> OAuth consent screen**, enter a product name to be shown to users, and click **Save**.
3. On the **Credentials** tab, click **Create credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**. 
4. Select an application type, enter a name for the application, and specify a redirect URI (enter https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground if you want to use 
[OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground) to receive the authorization code and obtain the refresh token). 
5. Click **Create**. Your client ID and client secret appear. 
6. In a separate browser window or tab, visit [OAuth 2.0 playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground), select the required Google Drive scopes, and then click **Authorize APIs**.
7. When you receive your authorization code, click **Exchange authorization code for tokens** to obtain the refresh token.

# Samples 

Import the Google Drive Listener module to your Ballerina program as follows.
i.e: The client connecter is imported to create a file in the drive here.

```ballerina
    
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/log;
import ballerinax/googleapis_drive as drive;
import ballerinax/googleapis_drive.'listener as listen;

configurable string callbackURL = ?;
configurable string clientId = ?;
configurable string clientSecret = ?;
configurable string refreshUrl = drive:REFRESH_URL;
configurable string refreshToken = ?;

string fileName = "<NEW_FILE_NAME>";

    drive:Configuration config = {
        clientConfig: {
            clientId: clientId,
            clientSecret: clientSecret,
            refreshUrl: refreshUrl,
            refreshToken: refreshToken
        }
    };

    listen:ListenerConfiguration configuration = {
        port: 9090,
        callbackURL: callbackURL,
        clientConfiguration: config
    };

    listener listen:DriveEventListener gDrivelistener = new (configuration);

    service / on gDrivelistener {
        isolated remote function onFileCreate(drive:Change changeInfo) returns error? {
            log:printInfo("Trigger > onFileCreate > changeInfo : ", changeInfo);     
        }
    }

public function main() returns error? {
    drive:Client driveClient = check new (config);
    drive:File|error response = driveClient->createFile(fileName);
    if (response is drive:File) {
        log:printInfo(response.toString());
    }
}

```
## Notes : 

1. If the listener should listen for changes only in a specific folder, specify the folder Id in `ListenerConfiguration`.

```
    listen:ListenerConfiguration configuration = {
        port: 9090,
        callbackURL: callbackURL,
        clientConfiguration: config,
        specificFolderOrFileId : parentFolderId
    };
```
2. If you want to specify a custom expiration time. Specify it in the listener configuration.
```
    listen:ListenerConfiguration configuration = {
        port: 9090,
        callbackURL: callbackURL,
        clientConfiguration: config,
        specificFolderOrFileId : parentFolderId,
        expiration : 100000
    };
```
